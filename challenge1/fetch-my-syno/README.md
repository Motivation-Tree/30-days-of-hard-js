**[Demo](https://dub.sh/fetch-my-syno)**

**Stack**: Next 14/Typescript/Next UI/Tailwind/Google makesuite API

**Features:** Word info/Type/Synonyms/Example sentences -- Per type

**Development time:** 8 to 10 hours

**Good side:** More than asked features/Better stack/Better DX/Best practices

**Bad side:** Why to implement extra features. Too late. Time (10 hours, no)

**Ideal:** It supposed to be functional, just an input and `ul` to show synonyms. (max time 3 hours.)

### How was the experience

- 1st time integrated Server actions (really hate),
- 1st time used AI API. It was really cool but to format the data from repsonse was not cool.

### What can be improved

- Add loader
- Make UI/UX even  better
- RND

### Can it be used a production project or as SAAS

- It is good as hobby saas. Fun project
- But in production some corner cases needs to handle.
- I don't trust AI api response, it can be changed. That's a risk.

Thanks
