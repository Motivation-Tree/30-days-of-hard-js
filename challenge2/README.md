**[Demo](https://dub.sh/persistent-bg-counter-loDMazf)**

### End Goal

- Make sure the timer continues ticking even when the **user closes and reopens the tab**.

### Features and implementations

**Stack**: React/Typescript/Vite/Vanilla CSS/Browser API (Local storage)
**Features:** Persist state even page refresh or tab is closed counter stays running on background
**Development time:** RnD (5 hours) + Dev time (3 hours)
**Good side:** 80 % what was asked.
**Bad side:** Time cost is 8 hours. Implemented counter instead of timer
**Ideal:** It supposed to be timer. (3 to 5 (max) hours.)

### How was the experience

- I really enjoyed, and learned a lot.
- Date time functions, I hate. That's why I switch the timer to counter.
- 1st time used I used beforeOnLoad event listener

### What can be improved

- Make it timer not counter
- Make UI/UX even better
- RND

### Can it be used a production project or as SAAS

- Make it timer and use it in production. As a counter yes it is ready to use in production

Thanks
